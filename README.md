# Pyre-Death-Stun-Talisman
A mod for pyre that uses a unused image (in the files with the name "nope") to create a new talisman.

Requires my version of the mod importer [here](https://github.com/erumi321/sgg-mod-format). Also requires ModUtil found on Github [here](https://github.com/SGG-Modding/sgg-mod-format) or Nexus Mods [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/27)
